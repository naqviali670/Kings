Kings without ruling children
We store information about the birth and ruling years of kings of the Árpád dynasty. We
only investigate years where there was continuously a king, and only one at a time, and
each king ruled only for one interval.
Write a program that gives the count of kings who had children, but none of their children
became kings.
Input:
The first line of the standard input contains the count of kings (1≤N≤100). The next
N lines each contain the information about a king: the beginning and the end of their rule
0≤year1,year2≤2000), and their name (names are all diferent). The next line contains
the count of relationships of the Arpad dynasty (1≤M≤1000). The next 2*M lines contain
a parent-child relationship: the first line is the parent, the second line is the child.
Output:
The first line of the standard output should contain the count of kings who had children,
but none of their children became kings.
